# School Registration/Management API (FastAPI Backend)

## Overview 
This project modernizes a legacy PHP-based school registration system by migrating it to a FastAPI, API-first backend. The original system (circa 2013) tightly coupled backend SQL logic with a server-rendered frontend, making it difficult to scale, maintain, or support modern clients.

The new backend cleanly separates concerns and provides a reusable REST API that supports the school’s existing registration workflows and enables future web and mobile frontends.

The system is used by 300+ families for student registration, class enrollment, payments, and volunteer tracking.

## Core Features 
### Family & Account Management  
- Supports existing families and new family onboarding.  
- New families can:   
    - Create an account  
    - Enter familiy information  
    - Add students (children) & student information  
    - Edit information  
- Existing families can:  
    - Log in and manage family and student records      

### Student Registration
- Each school term, parents can:
    - Register students for available classes
    - View current and past class enrollments
- Registration workflows mirror legacy PHP behavior to ensure continuity

### Records & History
- Parents can view:
    - Past registrations
    - Payment history
    - Volunteer activity records

### Authentication (Google, Facebook, Yahoo)
- Log in with third-party authorization so that no passwords are stored
- Verify user identity

## System Architecture
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: Existing SQL database (accessed via phpMyAdmin)
- API Design:
    - RESTful endpoints
    - Modular router structure by domain:
        - family
        - student
        - registration
        - etc.
- Data Validation:
    - Typed request/response schemas using Pydantic models
    - Schema definitions mirror existing database tables

## Migration Approach
- Analyzed the existing PHP codebase to understand:
    - Business logic
    - SQL queries
    - Registration workflows
- Reverse-engineered legacy endpoints and recreated them in FastAPI
- Preserved existing database structure and behavior to maintain data integrity
- Incrementally validated functionality against the legacy system

## Testing & Documentation 
- Interactive API documentation provided via Swagger UI / OpenAPI
- Unit tests added to verify endpoint behavior and reduce regression risk
- Version control managed with Git and GitHub

## Future Improvements 
- Authentication and role-based access control
- Frontend clients (web or mobile) consuming the same API
- Improved reporting and admin tooling
